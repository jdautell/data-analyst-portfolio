# Demographic Analysis of Telemedicine Trends Case Study
## Introduction
This study aims to uncover demographic trends in telemedicine usage, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, using SQL for data extraction and Tableau for visualizations.

**Objective**: Investigate demographic trends in telemedicine usage during the COVID-19 pandemic.

- **Ask**: Study the evolution of telemedicine usage over time and the influence of age, state, and income level on its adoption.
- **Prepare**: Data sourced from the CDC's website. Utilized SQL for extraction and Tableau for visualization.
- **Analyze**: Found a rise in telemedicine adoption during the pandemic, with variations based on age, state, and income.
- **Share**: Older age groups show increased adoption but with higher variability. Geographically, coastal regions have higher telemedicine uptake than central and rural states. 
- **Act**: Strategic actions encompass enhancing telemedicine platforms for the elderly, advocating for better broadband in areas with low adoption, and ensuring telemedicine is accessible across all income levels.

## Ask
* Objective: Understand the demographic trends in telemedicine usage.
* Key Questions:
  * Evolution of telemedicine usage over time.
  * Differences in telemedicine adoption across age groups.
  * Telemedicine usage variation across states.
  * Influence of income level on telemedicine adoption.
  * Age groups showing more variability in telemedicine usage patterns.
    
## Prepare or Collect Data
* Data Source: Dataset "Telemedicine Use in the Last 4 Weeks" from CDC's website.
* Tools Used: SQL for data extraction and Tableau for visualization.

## Clean and Process
Data was cleaned to exclude null values and structured into various categories like overall trends, state-wise trends, age group trends, and income level trends.

## Analyze
Key findings include the rise of telemedicine adoption during the pandemic, higher adoption in older age groups, state variability in adoption, and influence of income levels on adoption patterns.

## Share & Act
This section offers interpretations and strategic actions for stakeholders such as healthcare providers, policymakers, and telemedicine platforms based on the analysis.
